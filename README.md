My New Blog App!
Hello! I'm an enthusiastic Node.js learner, and I just created my new blog app. This Readme.md file serves as documentation for my project. I hope you enjoy it!

Overview
My blog app is a web platform where users can share their ideas, opinions, and knowledge with the community. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete posts, make comments on other users' posts, follow other users, and much more!

Technologies Used
The app was developed using several technologies, including:

Node.js: an open-source, JavaScript-based software platform for creating scalable, high-performance network applications.
Express: a web framework for Node.js that provides a variety of features for web applications, such as routing, middleware, session support, and more.
MongoDB: a document-oriented NoSQL database used to store the app's data.
Mongoose: a MongoDB object modeling library for Node.js that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for working with MongoDB databases.
Features
Here are some of the features of my blog app:

User authentication: users can sign up and log in to the app.
Posts: users can create, edit, and delete their own posts.
Comments: users can make comments on other users' posts.
User profile: users can customize their profiles and add information about themselves.
